# SynchGHS algorithm 
## for Minimum spanning tree construction in a Distributed System

**  For details on algorithm /proof of correctness/complexity analysis, refer to Chapter 4.4 of Nancy A Lynch's book on distributed computing. chapter 4.4

** Compilation order: **
- IncidentEdgeType.java
- AdjTuple.java
- Edge.java
- MessageType.java
- Message.java
- NodeState.java
- Node.java
- Main.java

you can also use 
```
javac Main
```
** for running the project ** 
```
cd Launcher &  chmod +x launcher.sh & ./launcher.sh "config001.txt"
```
Give the path as per your configuration

** Note **: The message types used here might be slightly different from the ones in the textbook
